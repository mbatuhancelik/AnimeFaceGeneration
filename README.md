Purpose: Getting some stuff working on tensorflow after completing Coursera course on DNN's 

first generation: 

Getting familiar with GAN's and gradient tapes. 
Used https://www.kaggle.com/splcher/animefacedataset/notebooks as dataset, but sadly 64x64 waifus does not look pretty. 
Therefore, I abandonned this model and did not tried to further develop it. 

second generation: 
This time I'm following https://nips2017creativity.github.io/doc/High_Quality_Anime.pdf. At this point, I created my own dataset from getchu, but I m fucking bored when cleaning up false positives, so I'm putting my files in order and creating a github repo.
